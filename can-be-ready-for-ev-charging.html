    <h2>But why do we need a public place to charge electric vehicles?</h2>

    <section>
        <h3>Demand</h3>

        <p>
            The <a target="_blank"
                href="https://thedriven.io/2019/09/06/australians-consider-shift-electric-vehicles-doubled/">demand</a>
            for
            electric vehicles is <a target="_blank"
                href="https://thedriven.io/2019/09/10/interest-in-pre-loved-electric-vehicles-gains-momentum-in-australia/">increasing</a>.
            And businesses are expanding to help consumers charge those vehicles. Unfortunately, the
            Central Coast of New South Wales hasn't been a <a target="_blank"
                href="https://thedriven.io/2019/09/26/chargefox-reveals-locations-of-australias-largest-network-of-ultra-rapid-chargers/">focal
                point</a> for the <a target="_blank"
                href="https://www.mynrma.com.au/community/initiatives/electric-vehicle-fast-charging-network">expansion</a>.
            We can't be left behind.

        <p>
            For a lot of people, their next vehicle will likely be electric. For them, a quick
            recharge on the coast could be desired if:
            <ul>
                <li>it was a longer than expected day of driving,</li>
                <li>they decided to head out of town, for example on the M1, or</li>
                <li>just because they wanted a top-off.</li>
            </ul>
            At the end of the day, it will be pretty much for all the same reasons they used to stop by the <i>old
                petrol station</i>.

        <h3>Tourism</h3>
        <p>
            It's needless to say, but our weekends are not lost. EV's will in fact be <a target="_blank"
                href="https://thedriven.io/2019/09/16/why-ev-rapid-charging-technology-is-vital-to-australias-tourism-industry/">vital</a>
            to people, especially those visting or travelling through the Central Coast.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Central Coast can be a first stop to recharge both your car and yourself before heading north or south
            of NSW. For those people who have just made it out of Sydney, charging in the Central Coast will be a
            neccessity. While they are here, they can make the best of the detour by exploring everything our home has
            to offer.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Central Coast can be a <i>hub</i> for visiting EV owners and enthusiasts. EV cars are just the
            start; soon electric utes, SUVs, and four-wheel drives will be travelling our way. Just like their petrol
            and diesel counterparts, it is likely EV ownwers will desire driving on our beautiful coastal roads or going
            off-road in our great outdoors. Our community can not
            disregard them.

    <h2>An Idea</h2>

    <section>
        <h3>Let's create an open and accessible charging location where you can meet other EV enthusiasts, or just get a
            quick charge and be on your way!</h3>

        <p>
            There are probably a number of places where a centralised charging location could be set up. My idea is to
            use a well-known location that can handle a large number of vehicles. With the recent and unfortunate
            closure of the <b>Gosford Classic Cars Museum</b>, that site can be re-utilised and retrofitted perfectly.

            <ul>
                <li>It's accessible from the M1</li>
                <li>It's close to a number of nearby amenities to support long-term and short-term visitors</li>
                <li>It has lots of space for both outside and undercover charging</li>
                <li>The facilities can be expanded to support other ventures, e.g. internal shops, kiosks, food
                    services, etc.</li>
                <li>Being in West Gosford means it's at the doorstep of access to the rest of the Central Coast</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>But it's still early days</h3>
        <p>
            Other than retaining the old museum, there's still a number of other items to consider. For example, can
            this venture be based on a partnership with an existing EV charging company to establish the chargers?

            But more importantly, is the community interested?
